# scripts directory
Directory to hold scripts for this project.

The expectation is that this should be filled with various organizing subsdirectories.  The scripts
in any given directory will produce output/data in the corresponding directory in the
"processed" area.  In virtually all cases a script should be possible (even if it is just a
one-liner that executes a different command), but in the rare instances where that's not the case,
there should at least be a README to indicate what was done to generate the data.
